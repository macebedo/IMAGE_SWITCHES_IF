This is not a tutorials. There are my codes created for the request below:

Create a basic webpage that will include to number images side by side.  Both number images should start with a zero showing.  Under each number image will be a text input to get a number from the user.  Provide an appropriate user prompt indicating what should be done.

Users should be able to enter a number from 1 to 5 in either text input.  Clicking on the corresponding image will trigger a function that checks the users input and updates the number image to match the input.

One image update processing is to use if/then statements.  The second image update processing is to use a switch statement.

If the user input is not a number, alert them for proper input.  If the user enters a number not in the 1 to 5 range, alert them their number is too small or large.
